# Data Demands - For Daily Data Usage

This is a repository that will contain most daily scripts I use for data manipulating and transformation.

Most of these scripts were created to satisfy on-demand duties, and while some of them were used for specific cases, others are more generic to accomplish regular data tasks, such as:

- Excel data conversion;
- CSV transformation, including extracting and reordering columns, merging files and converting to either XLS or JSON formats;
- SQL queries;
- API Scripts;
